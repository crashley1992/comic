# Comic-Can Project 
This app allows users to search information about their favorite characters and superheroes. Users will obtain informations about their superheroes and if users are interested in the character, they would be able to save the character for future purposes.


# How the app works
Simply enter the name of the superhero you would like to know, and click Kapow! button. After you hit the Kapow! button, the image and information will appear on the page and if you are interested in a character, you would be able to put them in a search box by hitting Save Character button. When it is offically saved the superhero cannot be interacted with but will still be visible on the saved box so the users would know what superhero they have saved.
